# Online42
I want to create an online multiplayer 42 game. I think javascript and html will be the easiest method to achieve this for now.
I would be interested with assitance if someone was interesested. You can email me at alecautry20181@gmail.com
I am a noive programmer and I have only taken a few classes but I am trying to learn more. I really emjoy playing the Domino game 42 and want a way to play online with friends.
There currently is no online version of the game so I figured I would try and do it myself.
